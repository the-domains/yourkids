# Ad-free!

YourKids.com is Ad-Free & Proud. Currently we're updating regularly with the latest info about your kids online.

Please let me know what you think we should cover. Our team have extensive experience with kids in education, as parents, as foster parents, and from working online with kids since 1998\. 

What are your thoughts? We're really keen to hear from parents or teachers especially. What do you think needs to be shared about kids in this online world? You can send your feed back to me, Mark at the following address - you'll need to manually copy this address and take out the space (just so we know you're have real intelligence as opposed to a artificial intelligence!):
