There's a lot of talk about 'rewiring the brain' but of course the brains of teenagers are rewiring the Internet. For example, after incessant warnings about safety and identity on the Internet kids, who hated the idea of their postings being public anyway - voted with their clicks and made SnapChat the phenonenon that it is.

I can chat and send pictures securely. I know who gets the pictures and I know that they will be deleted as soon as that person sends them. The idea of whether or not SnapChat is absolutely safe is moot. The point is: the app market responded to that felt need.
